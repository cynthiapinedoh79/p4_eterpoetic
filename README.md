## 🔌 API Endpoints (Optional)

This section should list the URLs used for non-HTML data interaction, which may include features necessary for frontend interactivity.

| URL Path | HTTP Method | Description | Data Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`/api/poems/toggle-favorite/<int:poem_id>/`** | `POST` | Toggles the user's favorite status on a poem (Used for seamless frontend updates). | JSON (Expected Success/Failure) |

| `/api/collaborate/submit/` | `POST` | Endpoint that receives the form data for a new collaborator request. | JSON (Expected Success/Error) |

## 🔒 Securing Your API Keys and Secrets

The use of **Social Media Login (OAuth)** requires that you manage sensitive credentials (like Facebook App ID, Google Client Secret, and your main Django `SECRET_KEY`) securely.

[cite_start]The most crucial rule is that **NO secret key or token should ever be committed to your GitHub repository**[cite: 1, 2].

#### 1. Verification of Heroku Config Vars

You must verify that all sensitive keys are set as **Config Vars** (Environment Variables) on Heroku.

| Key | Purpose | Required Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`SECRET_KEY`** | Django application security | Heroku Config Vars |
| **`SOCIAL_AUTH_FACEBOOK_KEY & SOCIAL_AUTH_FACEBOOK_SECRET`** | Facebook App ID & Facebook App Secret | Heroku Config Vars |
| **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID / GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`** | Google Client_ID & Client_SECRET | Heroku Config Vars |
| **`CLOUDINARY_URL`** | `cloudinary://API_KEY:API_SECRET@CLOUD_NAME` | Heroku Config Vars |
| **`EMAIL_HOST`** | `smtp.gmail.com` | Heroku Config Vars |

You can check your existing Heroku Config Vars by running:
```bash
heroku config -a eterpoetic
```

## 💻 Development Environment Tools

We relied on various software tools and platforms throughout the development and troubleshooting process, with **Google's SMTP** used for secure email delivery instead of Brevo:

| Tool/Platform | Role in Project | Fixes Highlighted |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python/Django** | Core application framework and programming language. | Resolving `ModuleNotFoundError`, template syntax errors, and URL reversal issues. |
| **Heroku** | Production deployment and hosting platform. | Fixing the deployment `Server Error (500)` and resolving CLI and migration sync issues. |
| **VS Code / Gitpod** | Integrated Development Environment (IDE). | Resolving VS Code Server connection failures and rebuilding native modules like `node-pty`. |
| **Homebrew** | Package manager used to install Heroku CLI in the Linux environment. | Resolving "Heroku CLI command not found" errors. |
| **Google SMTP** | [cite_start]External service used for secure, production-ready email delivery, requiring an **App Password** for authentication [cite: 594-596]. | [cite_start]Fixing email delivery for password resets and other user notifications by configuring `EMAIL_HOST` to `'smtp.gmail.com'` and providing the 16-digit App Password [cite: 594-596]. |
| **Bootstrap (5.3.3)** | Frontend framework for responsiveness, styling, and components. | Used for consistent UI patterns and responsive design. |
| **Hover.css / jQuery** | **Hover.css** added float transitions; **jQuery** provided smooth scroll and DOM manipulation. | Used for interactive elements and visual polish. |
| **Git / GitHub** | Version control and remote repository storage. | Essential for collaboration and deployment via Heroku. |

## 🐞 Bugs and Known Issues Log

### Solved Issues

| Problem | What Caused It | How It Was Fixed |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Admin Login Error** | Django expected a “Site” entry in the database, but none existed. | Removed `django.contrib.sites` from `INSTALLED_APPS`. |
| **Missing `dj_database_url`** | The database-URL helper package wasn’t installed. | Installed it with pip. |
| **Missing Cloudinary Modules** | Cloudinary packages were required for media storage but not installed. | Installed `cloudinary` + `django-cloudinary-storage`. |
| **Missing `crispy_forms`** | Project used Crispy Forms, but it wasn’t installed. | Installed `django-crispy-forms` and `crispy-bootstrap5`. |
| **Missing `django_summernote`** | Summernote editor package wasn’t installed. | Installed `django-summernote`. |
| **500 Error (caused by NoReverseMatch)** | A template tried to use a URL named `"home"` that didn’t exist. | Turned on DEBUG → added the missing URL name → updated template to `blog:home`. |
| **POST Request Missing Trailing Slash** | A POST was sent to `/edit_comment/16` instead of `/edit_comment/16/`. | Updated redirect logic to point to the correct URL. |
| **Heroku 500 Startup Error** | Heroku had an incorrect `CLOUDINARY_URL` value. | Updated the Cloudinary environment variable. |
| **Migrations Out of Sync** | Heroku’s database was missing a Summernote migration. | Re-ran migrations on Heroku. |
| **Missing Allauth Join Table** | A needed table for social login wasn’t created. | Created the table manually with SQL. |
| **Local HTTPS Error** | Browser tried to open the dev server using HTTPS. | Cleared HSTS settings and used `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. |
| **Heroku CLI Not Found** | Heroku CLI wasn’t installed or not in PATH. | Installed Homebrew → fixed PATH → installed Heroku CLI. |
| **Local Email Not Working** | Needed different setups for test vs production email. | Local: console backend. Production: Brevo SMTP in env vars. |
| **VS Code Server Wouldn’t Connect** | VS Code Server couldn’t download properly. | Reinstalled correctly, allowed firewall access, cleared cache, enabled cookies. |
| **Tests Failing** | Wrong URLs, bad redirects, misplaced variables, missing session messages. | Fixed URL names, added `follow=True`, moved variables, updated views. |

---

### Known Issues

| Issue | What’s Going On |
|-------|------------------|
| **Password mismatch not caught** | Confirm-password field is named `password_again` but allauth expects `password2`. Needs a custom signup form. |
| **Static files not updating on Heroku** | Browser/CDN caching sometimes keeps old files. Requires hard refresh or dyno restart. |
| **Heroku argument parsing bug** | Heroku sometimes breaks with flags like `--noinput`. Requires using:  
`heroku run -- python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` |

    <img src="static/images/readme/screenshots/herokudeploy/ResourcesHeroku1.png">

    </details>

    #### Heroku Postgres Setup

    1. Heroku automatically provides DATABASE_URL via Config Vars.
        This variable is not stored locally and not committed to version control (env.py/.env)

    2. Install the plugins dj-database-url and psycopg2-binary.
        ```bash
            pip3 install dj-database-url psycopg2-binary gunicorn
        ```
        - Create a Procfile with the text: web: gunicorn eterpoetic.wsgi

            <img src="static/images/readme/screenshots/herokudeploy/procfile.png">

            </details>

    3. Run pip3 freeze > requirements.txt so both are added to the requirements.txt file

        <details>

        <img src="static/images/readme/screenshots/herokudeploy/requirements.png">

        </details>

4. In the settings.py ensure the connection is to the Heroku postgres database, no indentation if you are not using a separate test database env.py/.env
    Remove or comment out DATABASE_URL in .env locally for 
    Local → SQLite (db.sqlite3). 
    Heroku → Postgres (via Config Vars). 
    Clean separation

### 🖥️ Local Deployment (Development)

The project can be run locally by following the steps below. This allows another developer to clone, configure, and run the application in a development environment.

**Security Note:**
Local environment variables must be stored in a local **.env (or env.py) file**, and this file must be included **in .gitignore to ensure sensitive data is not committed to the repository**.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd p4_eterpoetic
    ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install project dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure local environment variables (do not commit secrets or data with compromised information):

    | Config Var | Purpose | Importance |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | **`SECRET_KEY`** | Django Local security key. | **Required.** locally in .env |
    | **`DEBUG`** | Development mode | True locally, False in production |
    | **`DATABASE_URL`** | Local DB connection. | **Required.** PostgreSQL URL or a SQLite. |
    | **`CLOUDINARY_URL`** | Media storage API. | **Required.** for images. |
    | **`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID / GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`** | Google OAuth authentication. | Optional|
    | **`FACEBOOK_APP_ID / FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`** | Facebook OAuth authentication. | Optional|
    | **`EMAIL_HOST`** | SMTP server host | Optional |
    | **`EMAIL_HOST_USER`** | SMTP username | Optional |
    | **`EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`** | SMTP app password | Optional|
    | **`DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`** | Default sender email address | Optional |
    | **`ALLOWED_HOSTS`** | Allowed hostnames | Required in production |

5. Apply database migrations:
    ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
    ```
6. Create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
7. Run the development server:
    ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
    ```
8. Open the application in a browser:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/


### 🐞 Deployment-Related Solved Issues

| Problem | What Caused It | How It Was Fixed |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Heroku 500 Error on Startup** | Heroku was using an old or invalid `CLOUDINARY_URL`, so the app crashed while loading. | Updated the Cloudinary environment variable in Heroku to the correct, active one. |
| **Model Changes Not Applied on Heroku** | Heroku’s database didn’t have the latest changes for `django_summernote`, causing warnings about missing migrations. | Ran migrations on Heroku after pushing updated migration files. |
| **Heroku CLI “command not found”** | The Heroku command-line tool wasn’t installed or the system PATH wasn’t configured. | Installed Homebrew → fixed PATH → installed the Heroku CLI via Homebrew. |
| **Heroku Misreading Command Flags** | Heroku interpreted Django flags (e.g., `--noinput`) as Heroku flags. | Added `--` before the Django command: `heroku run -- python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` |

---

### ⚠️ Known Deployment Issues

| Known Issue | Status/Impact | Root Cause |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Static File Deployment Cache** | **Intermittent:** Front-end changes occasionally require hard refreshes (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R`) to display on the live Heroku site. | WhiteNoise + browser caching: static files are aggressively cached unless their hashed filenames change. If a file’s hash doesn’t update, browsers may continue serving the old version. |

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

To ensure code quality and a clear project history, please adhere to the following guidelines when contributing:

### 🌳 Branch Naming Convention

When you begin new work, create a branch using one of these prefixes to clearly define the nature of your changes:

| Prefix | Use Case | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`feat/`** | New features or adding significant functionality. | `feat/user-onboarding-flow` |
| **`fix/`** | Bug fixes or corrections to existing incorrect behavior. | `fix/social-account-table` |
| **`docs/`** | Changes to documentation only (README, Wiki, guides). | `docs/update-readme-bugs` |

### ✅ Pull Request (PR) Requirements

Before a Pull Request can be merged into the `main` branch, it **must** satisfy these two core criteria:

* **Passing Tests** 🧪: All unit and integration tests must execute without failure.
* **Clean Linting** ✨: The code must pass all configured style and quality checks (linting).
