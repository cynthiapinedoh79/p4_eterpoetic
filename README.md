## 🎨 Design Choices
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Consistent spacing and UI patterns
- Accessible markup and navigation

  ### Description        
  This website is designed for visitors and new customers to explore, learn, win rewards, and enjoy an engaging experience while navigating through different pages.

  ### Typography
  Inter, Roboto family font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

  ### Color Palette 
    - **Fonts:** Roboto, Inter – clean and modern  
    - **Colors:**  
      - Purple: trust and creativity  
      - Red/Orange: urgency and emphasis  
      - Muted tones: professionalism  
    - [Contrast checked with WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

  ### Colour Psychology
    ![Colour Psicology](assets/images/readme/PsColor.png)
    ![Contrast checked with WebAIM](assets/images/readme/PsColor1.png)

  ### Imagery  
    Clear and attractive images support the theme and maintain strong contrast with text for optimal readability.
  - Financial and office-themed backgrounds  
  - High contrast text overlays for readability

## 📐 Five Planes UXD

### 📌 Strategy
Define goals and audience needs.

Our objective is to create a website that is both professional and functional. Our focus is on design that is both intuitive and creative.

![Strategy](assets/images/readme/fivePlanes/strategy.png)
### 📐 Scope
The site is designed for two main user groups:
1.	Visitors, who can enjoy interactive games, helpful tips, new information, and practical advice.
2.	Potential new customers, who can explore special offers like a bookkeeping bonus award, contact us easily, or quickly access the Form 1040 submission link.

![Scope pg1](assets/images/readme/fivePlanes/scope1.png)

![Scope pg2](assets/images/readme/fivePlanes/scope2.png)
### 🏗️ Structure
The website is designed with HTML5, CSS3 and JS.

**Website Pages/Apps:**
1. **_Home:_** Description of Home, features
1. **_App1:_** Description of App1, features
2. **_App2:_** Description of App2, features
3. **_App3:_** Description of App3, features

![Structure](assets/images/readme/fivePlanes/structure.png)

### 🦴 Skeleton
Wireframes and layout structure.
The website is designed to be clear and simple. And the site has a simple tree structure with hierarchical flows from top to bottom.

**Wireframe**
The wireframe is designed using Balsamiq software 
[Balsamic](https://balsamiq.cloud/ss26tqg/p4441iq/rD01A)

#### Home
![Home](assets/images/readme/Bals/Bals-Home.png)

### 🎨 Surface
Final aesthetic layers (colors, components, imagery).
To create a pleasing and understandable view, I opt for natural colors such as earth, green, and a range of tones that complement and contrast each other.
